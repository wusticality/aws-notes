# Sharing

This page talks about how to share various resources across accounts.

## S3

There are three different ways to share S3 buckets across accounts.

* Using bucket policies and IAM (entire bucket, programmatic access only).
* Using bucket access control lists and IAM (individual objects, programmatic access only).
* Cross-account IAM roles (programmatic and console access).
