Know the difference between AWS regions, availability zones, and edge locations.

A _region_ is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more availability zones.

An _availability zone_ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

_Edge locations_ are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's content delivery network (CDN).
