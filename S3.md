# S3

What exactly is S3?

* S3 is a safe place to store your files.
* The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
* It is object-based storage.
* Not suitable to install an operating system on.
* Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB.
* There is unlimited storage.
* Files are stored in buckets.
* If you upload a file to S3 successfully, you will receive an HTTP 200 code.
* S3 is a universal namespace - names must be globally unique.
* Amazon guarantees 99.99% availability.
* Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (11 9's).

## S3 urls

S3 urls are of the following form:

The url to an S3 bucket looks like this for the default region (North Virginia).

https://wusticality.s3.amazonaws.com/

For other regions (say Oregon), it will look like this:

https://wusticality.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

## Objects
 
An object in S3 has a key (the name), value (the bytes), a version id, and metadata.

There are also subresources like access control lists and torrents.

## Consistency

Read after write consistency for PUT's of new objects. If you write a new files and read it immediately afterwords, you will be able to view that data.

Eventual consistency for overwrite PUT's and DELETE's. If you update an _existing_ file or _delete_ a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version or you may not. Changes to objects can take time to propagate.

## Features

* Tiered storage.
* Lifecycle management.
* Encryption.
* Versioning.
* MFA delete.
* Access control lists.
* Bucket policies.

## Storage classes

Here are the various storage classes:

* S3 Standard
* S3 - IA (infrequently accessed)
* S3 - Intelligent Tiering
* S3 One Zone - IA
* S3 Glacier
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive

### S3 Standard

* 99.99% availability
* 99.999999999% durability (11 9's)

This data is stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

### S3 - IA (infrequently accessed)

For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Costs less than S3 Standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee.

### S3 - Intelligent Tiering

Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. It uses machine learning to do this based on how often objects are accessed.

### S3 One Zone - IA (infrequently accessed)

When you want a cheaper option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require multiple availability zone data resilience.

### S3 RRS (reduced redundancy storage)

This is old and being phased out and is similar to S3 One Zone - IA.

### S3 Glacier

This is a secure, durable, cheap option for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times are configurable from minutes to hours.

### S3 Glacier Deep Archive

This is the cheapest option where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

## Billing

You are charged for S3 in the following ways:

* Storage.
* Requests.
* Storage management pricing (tiers).
* Data transfer pricing.
* Cross region replication pricing.
* Transfer acceleration.

### Cross region replication pricing

This is when data is replicated from one bucket to another automatically.

### Transfer acceleration

This enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. It takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

For example, if a user sends something to S3, it will first hit up an edge location, and then travel to S3 over Amazon's backbone network.

## Security

By default, all newly created buckets are _private_. You can setup access control to your buckets using:

* Bucket policies.
* Access control lists.

S3 buckets can also be configured to create access logs. This logs all requests made to the bucket. This can be sent to another bucket or even another bucket in another account.

## Encryption

Encryption in transit (over the wire) is achieved by SSL / TLS.

You can encrypt your files yourself on the client-side and upload them to S3. For encryption at rest server-side, there are several options. Amazon encrypts objects individually.

### SSE-S3

Server side encryption. Amazon uses a separate key for each object.

### SSE-KMS

Server side encryption with customer master keys (CMSs) stored in Amazon key management service (KMS).

### SSE-C

Server side encryption with customer provided keys.

## Versioning

* Stores all versions of an object (including writes and if you delete an object).
* This is a great backup tool.
* Once enabled, cannot be disabled, only suspended.
* Integrates with lifecycle rules.
* Uses MFA delete, which provides an additional layer of security.

## Lifecycle management

* This automates moving your objects between different storage tiers. 
* It can be used in conjunction with versioning (you can move both current and previous versions).

## Exam Tips

Read through the S3 FAQs before taking the exam, they come up a lot!

* You will need to know the prices for the various tiers.
* You will have to choose the best tier given various scenarios.
